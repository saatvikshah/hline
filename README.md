# FIRE 2015 : Mixed Script Information Retrieval
Classifying text into Punctuations, 1 of 

## Subtask 1
All the code is in this repository.

To test the code:
1. Add the training and testing datasets in the corresponding folders.
2. Ready to use models, are on this [link](http://www19.zippyshare.com/v/OZDAyjDR/file.html). Just unzip and store in the *Resources/* folder. You can then run *main_demo.py* to check a demo of the classifiers at work. You can run *main.py* to generate a submission without the NE's subclassified.
3. NER subclassification will require you to add your bing api key at helpers.py and running the code *ne_subcategory_classification.py* once the submission has been generated to generate a new submission with NE's subclassified.

**We will soon release a library tool for ease of usage, so check this page for future updates**
