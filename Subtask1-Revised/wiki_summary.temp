Vgeorge w. bush george walker bush (born july 6, 1946) is an american politician and businessman who served as the 43rd president of the united states from 2001 to 2009, and the 46th governor of texas from 1995 to 2000. the eldest son of barbara and george h. w. bush, he was born in new haven, connecticut. after graduating from yale university in 1968 and harvard business school in 1975, he worked in oil businesses. he married laura welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the house of representatives shortly thereafter. he later co-owned the texas rangers baseball team before defeating ann richards in the 1994 texas gubernatorial election. he was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial election, becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than his opponent. he is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the first having been john quincy adams. he is also the brother of jeb bush, who is a former governor of florida and candidate for the republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election.\u000aeight months into bush's first term as president, the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred. bush responded by launching the war on terror, an international military campaign which included the war in afghanistan, launched in 2001 and the war in iraq, launched in 2003. he also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, social security reform, and amending the constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. he signed into law broad tax cuts, the patriot act, the no child left behind act, the partial-birth abortion ban act, medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the aids relief program known as pepfar. his tenure saw national debates on immigration, social security, electronic surveillance, and torture.\u000abush successfully ran for re-election against democratic senator john kerry in 2004, in another relatively close election. after his re-election, bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the iraq war, hurricane katrina, and other challenges. amid this criticism, the democratic party regained control of congress in the 2006 elections. in december 2007, the united states entered its longest post-world war ii recession, often referred to as the "great recession," prompting the bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. nationally, bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the september 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis. he was met with public protests even occurring during visits to the united kingdom.\u000abush left office in 2009 and since then, he has returned to texas and purchased a home in a suburban area of dallas. he is currently a public speaker, has written a memoir titled decision points, has taken up painting as a hobby, and his presidential library was opened in 2013. his presidency has been ranked among the worst in recent surveys of presidential scholars. 1946 births 20th-century american episcopalians 20th-century american businesspeople 20th-century

Vnegative (photography) in photography, a negative is an image, usually on a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film, in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. this reversed order occurs because of the extremely light-sensitive chemicals a camera film must use to capture an image quickly enough for ordinary picture-taking, which are darkened, rather than bleached, by exposure to light and subsequent photographic processing.\u000ain the case of color negatives, the colors are also reversed into their respective complementary colors. typical color negatives have an overall dull orange tint due to an automatic color-masking feature that ultimately results in improved color reproduction.\u000anegatives are normally used to make positive prints on photographic paper by projecting the negative onto the paper with a photographic enlarger or making a contact print. the paper is also darkened in proportion to its exposure to light, so a second reversal results which restores light and dark to their correct order.\u000anegatives were once commonly made on a thin sheet of glass rather than a plastic film, and some of the earliest negatives were made on paper.\u000ait is incorrect to call a photograph a negative solely because it is on a transparent material. transparent prints can be made by printing a negative onto special positive film, as is done to make traditional motion picture film prints for use in theaters. some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by reversal processing, which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film. positives on film or glass are known as transparencies or diapositives, and if mounted in small frames designed for use in a slide projector or magnifying viewer they are commonly called slides.\u000a\u000a all articles needing additional references all articles needing cleanup articles needing additional references from november 2008 articles needing cleanup from november 2008 cleanup tagged articles without a reason field from november 2008 commons category with local link same as on wikidata photographic film types photography equipment wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia pages needing cleanup from november 2008 negative filmedit negative imageedit negative filmedit referencesedit external linksedit

Vchile chile (/\u02c8t\u0283\u026ali/; spanish: [\u02c8t\u0283ile]), officially the republic of chile (spanish:  república de chile ), is a south american country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the andes to the east and the pacific ocean to the west. it borders peru to the north, bolivia to the northeast, argentina to the east, and the drake passage in the far south. chilean territory includes the pacific islands of juan fernández, salas y gómez, desventuradas, and easter island in oceania. chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) of antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the antarctic treaty.\u000athe arid atacama desert in northern chile contains great mineral wealth, principally copper. the relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center from which chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. southern chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. the southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.\u000aspain conquered and colonised chile in the mid-16th century, replacing inca rule in northern and central chile, but failing to conquer the independent mapuche that inhabited south-central chile. after declaring its independence from spain in 1818, chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic. in the 19th century, chile saw significant economic and territorial growth, ending mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the war of the pacific (1879\u201383) after defeating peru and bolivia. in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil. this development culminated with the 1973 chilean coup d'état that overthrew salvador allende's left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing. the regime headed by augusto pinochet ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a centre-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010.\u000achile is today one of south america's most stable and prosperous nations. it leads latin american nations in rankings of human development, competitiveness, income per capita, globalization, state of peace, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption. it also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state, and democratic development. chile is a founding member of the united nations, the union of south american nations and the community of latin american and caribbean states. 1818 establishments in south america all accuracy disputes all articles with dead external links all articles with unsourced statements articles containing spanish-language text articles with dmoz links articles with dutch-language external links articles with dead external links from december 2009 articles with dead external links from july 2013 articles with disputed statements from february 2014 articles with haudio microformats articles with unsourced statements from february 2014 articles with unsourced statements from july 2014 articles with unsourced statements from november 2014 cs1 spanish-language sources (es) chile countries in south america former spanish colonies g15 nations liberal democracies member states of the union of south american nations member states of the united nations pages containing links to subscription-only content pages using citations with accessdate and no url republics spanish-speaking countries and territories states and territories established in 1818 use dmy dates from january 2015 wikipedia articles needing clarification from may 2014 wikipedia articles needing page number citations from july 2013 wikipedia articles needing page number citations from september 2010 wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia articles with viaf identifiers wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages wikipedia semi-protected pages etymologyedit historyedit early historyedit spanish colonizationedit independence and nation buildingedit 20th centuryedit 21st centuryedit largest citiesedit climateedit biodiversityedit floraedit faunaedit topographyedit hydrographyedit demographicsedit ethnic groupsedit religionedit languagesedit identity and traditionsedit government and politicsedit foreign relationsedit administrative divisionsedit national symbolsedit militaryedit economyedit infrastructureedit transportedit telecommunicationsedit agricultureedit tourismedit educationedit higher educationedit healthedit cultureedit music and danceedit literatureedit cuisineedit folkloreedit mythologyedit cinemaedit sportsedit cultural heritageedit see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit

Vgovernment a government is the system by which a state or community is controlled. in the commonwealth of nations, the word government is also used more narrowly to refer to the collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state. this usage is analogous to what is called an "administration" in american english. furthermore, especially in american english, the concepts of the state and the government may be used synonymously to refer to the person or group of people exercising authority over a politically organized territory. finally, government is also sometimes used in english as a synonym for governance.\u000ain the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislators, administrators, and arbitrators. government is the means by which state policy is enforced, as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of the state. a form of government, or form of state governance, refers to the set of political systems and institutions that make up the organisation of a specific government.\u000agovernment of any kind currently affects every human activity in many important ways. for this reason, political scientists generally argue that government should not be studied by itself; but should be studied along with anthropology, economics, environmentalism, history, philosophy, science, and sociology. all articles to be expanded all articles with unsourced statements articles to be expanded from december 2012 articles to be expanded from january 2013 articles with unsourced statements from may 2011 articles with unsourced statements from october 2012 commons category with page title same as on wikidata forms of government government government institutions pages using web citations with no url political terminology use british english from january 2014 use dmy dates from may 2012 wikipedia articles needing clarification from august 2012 wikipedia articles needing clarification from october 2012 wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers political scienceedit classifying governmentedit the dialectical forms of governmentedit etymologyedit forms of government by associated attributesedit aristarchic attributesedit autocratic attributesedit monarchic attributesedit pejorative attributesedit by elements of who elects the empowerededit authoritarian attributesedit democratic attributesedit oligarchic attributesedit other attributesedit by elements of how power distribution is structurededit republican attributesedit federalism attributesedit other power structure attributesedit forms of government by other characteristic attributesedit by significant constitutional attributesedit by approach to regional autonomyedit theoretical and speculative attributesedit mapsedit see alsoedit referencesedit bibliographyedit further readingedit external linksedit

"harbor wave"; english pronunciation: /tsu\u02d0\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0mi/) , also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. in being generated by the displacement of water, a tsunami contrasts both with a normal ocean wave generated by wind and with tides, which are generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on bodies of water.\u000atsunami waves do not resemble normal sea waves, because their wavelength is far longer. rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide, and for this reason they are often referred to as tidal waves, although this usage is not favored by the scientific community because tsunamis are not tidal in nature. tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called "wave train". wave heights of tens of meters can be generated by large events. although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous and they can affect entire ocean basins; the 2004 indian ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the indian ocean.\u000athe greek historian thucydides suggested in his late-5th century bc history of the peloponnesian war, that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes, but the understanding of a tsunami's nature remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown. major areas of current research include trying to determine why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do; trying to accurately forecast the passage of tsunamis across the oceans; and also to forecast how tsunami waves would interact with specific shorelines. articles containing japanese-language text articles containing video clips cs1 japanese-language sources (ja) cs1 uses japanese-language script (ja) commons category with page title same as on wikidata earthquake engineering flood forms of water geological hazards natural hazards physical oceanography risk management tsunami water waves wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages terminologyedit tsunamiedit tidal waveedit seismic sea waveedit historyedit generation mechanismsedit seismicityedit landslidesedit meteotsunamisedit characteristicsedit drawbackedit scales of intensity and magnitudeedit intensity scalesedit magnitude scalesedit warnings and predictionsedit forecast of tsunami attack probabilityedit mitigationedit see alsoedit footnotesedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit

durgotsava , "festival of durga") or sharadotsav is an annual hindu festival in south asia that celebrates worship of the hindu goddess durga. it refers to all the six days observed as mahalaya, shashthi, maha saptami, maha ashtami, maha nabami and vijayadashami. the dates of durga puja celebrations are set according to the traditional hindu calendar and the fortnight corresponding to the festival is called devi paksha, "fortnight of the goddess"). devi paksha is preceded by mahalaya, the last day of the previous fortnight pitri paksha, "fortnight of the forefathers"), and is ended on kojagori lokkhi puja ("worship of goddess lakshmi on kojagori full moon night").\u000adurga puja festival marks the victory of goddess durga over the evil buffalo demon mahishasura. thus, durga puja festival epitomises the victory of good over evil.\u000adurga puja is widely celebrated in the indian states of assam, bihar, jharkhand, manipur, odisha, tripura and west bengal, where it is a five-day annual holiday. in west bengal, assam, tripura, which has a majority of bengali hindus and assamese hindus, it is the biggest festival of the year. not only is it the biggest hindu festival celebrated throughout the state, it is also the most significant socio-cultural event in bengali hindu society. apart from eastern india, durga puja is also celebrated in delhi, uttar pradesh, maharashtra, gujarat, punjab, kashmir, andhra pradesh, karnataka and kerala. durga puja is also celebrated as a major festival in nepal where 91% is hindu, and in bangladesh where the 8% population is hindu. nowadays, many diaspora assamese and bengali cultural organisations arrange for durgotsab in countries such as the united states, canada, united kingdom, australia, germany, france, the netherlands, singapore and kuwait, among others. in 2006, a grand durga puja ceremony was held in the great court of the british museum.\u000athe prominence of durga puja increased gradually during the british raj in bengal and erstwhile assam. after the hindu reformists identified durga with india, she became an icon for the indian independence movement. in the first quarter of the 20th century, the tradition of baroyari or community puja was popularised due to this. after independence, durga puja became one of the largest celebrated festivals in the whole world. it is also the largest open air art exhibition in the world.\u000adurga puja also includes the worship of shiva, who is durga's consort (durga is an aspect of goddess parvati), in addition to lakshmi, saraswati with ganesha and kartikeya, who are considered to be durga's children. worship of mother nature is done, through nine types of plant (called "kala bou"), including a plantain (banana) tree, which represent nine divine forms of goddess durga. modern traditions have come to include the display of decorated pandals and artistically depicted sculptures (murti) of durga, exchange of vijaya greetings and

\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0nd\u032a\u02b1i]; 2 october 1869 \u2013 30 january 1948) was the preeminent leader of the indian independence movement in british-ruled india. employing nonviolent civil disobedience, gandhi led india to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. the honorific mahatma (sanskrit: "high-souled", "venerable")\u2014applied to him first in 1914 in south africa,\u2014is now used worldwide. he is also called bapu (gujarati: endearment for "father", "papa") in india.\u000aborn and raised in a hindu merchant caste family in coastal gujarat, western india, and trained in law at the inner temple, london, gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in south africa, in the resident indian community's struggle for civil rights. after his return to india in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. assuming leadership of the indian national congress in 1921, gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achieving swaraj or self-rule.\u000agandhi famously led indians in challenging the british-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) dandi salt march in 1930, and later in calling for the british to quit india in 1942. he was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both south africa and india. gandhi attempted to practise nonviolence and truth in all situations, and advocated that others do the same. he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. he ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and social protest.\u000agandhi's vision of an independent india based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate muslim homeland carved out of india. eventually, in august 1947, britain granted independence, but the british indian empire was partitioned into two dominions, a hindu-majority india and muslim pakistan. as many displaced hindus, muslims, and sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the punjab and bengal. eschewing the official celebration of independence in delhi, gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. in the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to promote religious harmony. the last of these, undertaken on 12 january 1948 at age 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring india to pay out some cash assets owed to pakistan. some indians thought gandhi was too accommodating. nathuram godse, a hindu nationalist, assassinated gandhi on 30 january 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest at point-blank range.\u000aindians widely describe gandhi as the father of the nation (hindi: \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e). the title "the father of the nation" for gandhi is not an official title and has not been officially accorded by government of india. a rti query filed by a 10 year old girl from lucknow in feb 2012 revealed that pmo has no records of ever according such title to gandhi. mha and national archives of india also communicated of not having any records. origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on singapore radio) on 6 jul 1944 by subhash chandra bose where bose addressed gandhi as "the father of the nation". on 28 apr 1947, sarojini naidu during a conference also referred gandhi as "father of the nation". the rti applicant had also pleaded for gandhi to be officially declared as "father of the nation" to which the mha informed that gandhi cannot be accorded with the title by government of india since the indian constitution does not permit any titles except educational and military titles.\u000ahis birthday, 2 october, is commemorated as gandhi jayanti, a national holiday, and world-wide as the international day of

among them are the two global and economic centres of zürich and geneva.\u000athe establishment of the swiss confederation is traditionally dated to 1 august 1291, which is celebrated annually as swiss national day. the country has a long history of armed neutrality\u2014it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815\u2014and did not join the united nations until 2002. nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world. in addition to being the birthplace of the red cross, switzerland is home to numerous international organizations, including the second largest un office. on the european level, it is a founding member of the european free trade association, but notably, it is not part of the european union, nor the european economic area (and thus does not use the euro currency). however the country does participate in the schengen area and the eu's single market through a number of bilateral treaties.\u000astraddling the intersection of germanic and romance europe, switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: german, french, italian and romansh. therefore, the swiss, although predominantly german-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnicity or language; rather, switzerland's strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and alpine symbolism.\u000aswitzerland ranks high in several metrics of national performance, including government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic competitiveness, and human development. it has the highest nominal wealth per adult (financial and non-financial assets) in the world according to credit suisse and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product on the imf list. zürich and geneva each have been ranked among the top cities with the highest quality of life in the world (the former coming second globally according to mercer). all articles with dead external links articles containing french-language text articles containing german-language text articles containing italian-language text articles containing latin-language text articles containing old high german-language text articles containing romansh-language text articles containing non-english-language text articles with dmoz links articles with french-language external links articles with german-language external links articles with italian-language external links articles with dead external links from november 2010 cs1 german-language sources (de) cs1 maint: unrecognized language central europe coordinates on wikidata countries in europe federal countries french-speaking countries and territories german-speaking countries and territories good articles hds not on wikidata italian-speaking countries and territories landlocked countries liberal democracies member states of the council of europe member states of the organisation internationale de la francophonie member states of the united nations switzerland use british english from february 2014 use dmy dates from june 2015 western europe wikipedia articles with bnf identifiers wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia articles with isni identifiers wikipedia articles with lccn identifiers wikipedia articles with nla identifiers wikipedia articles with viaf identifiers wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages etymologyedit historyedit early historyedit old swiss confederacyedit napoleonic eraedit federal stateedit modern historyedit geographyedit climateedit environmentedit politicsedit direct democracyedit administrative divisionsedit foreign relations and international institutionsedit militaryedit economy and labour lawedit education and scienceedit switzerland and the european unionedit demographicsedit languagesedit healthedit urbanizationedit religionedit cultureedit literatureedit mediaedit sportsedit cuisineedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit

(/\u02c8h\u025bl\u0259s/; greek: \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2, ellás), is a country located in southeastern europe. according to the 2011 census, greece's population is around 10.8 million. athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by thessaloniki, which is commonly referred to as the co-capital.\u000agreece is strategically located at the crossroads of europe, asia, and africa. situated on the southern tip of the balkan peninsula, it shares land borders with albania to the northwest, the republic of macedonia and bulgaria to the north and turkey to the northeast. greece consists of nine geographic regions: macedonia, central greece, the peloponnese, thessaly, epirus, the aegean islands (including the dodecanese and cyclades), thrace, crete, and the ionian islands. the aegean sea lies to the east of the mainland, the ionian sea to the west, and the mediterranean sea to the south. greece has the longest coastline on the mediterranean basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km (8,498 mi) in length, featuring a vast number of islands, of which 227 are inhabited. eighty percent of greece is mountainous, with mount olympus being the highest peak at 2,917 m (9,570 ft).\u000amodern greece traces its roots to the civilization of ancient greece, which is considered the cradle of all western civilization, including democracy, western philosophy, the olympic games, western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, and western drama, including both tragedy and comedy. greece's rich historical legacy is reflected in large part by its 17 unesco world heritage sites, among the most in europe and the world.\u000aspanning an assortment of independent city-states and polities, the greeks had for centuries resisted foreign domination before being unified by alexander the great in the fourth century bce. through his rapid conquest of the ancient world, greek culture and science flourished, spreading from the eastern mediterranean to the indus river. annexed by rome in the second century bce, greece became an integral of the roman empire and the successive byzantine empire. the greek orthodox church, rooted in the first century ce, shaped the modern greek identity while transmitting greek traditions to the wider orthodox world. following centuries of ottoman rule, the nation state of greece was established in 1830 following the war of independence.\u000agreece is a democratic and developed country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life and a very high standard of living. a founding member of the united nations, greece was the tenth member to join the european communities (precursor to the european union) and has been part of the eurozone since 2001. it is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the council of europe, nato, oecd, osce and the wto. greece, which is one of the world's largest shipping powers

Vkolkata kolkata /ko\u028al\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0t\u0251\u02d0/, formerly calcutta /kæl\u02c8k\u028ct\u0259/, is the capital of the indian state of west bengal. located on the east bank of the hooghly river, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of east india, while the port of kolkata is india's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. as of 2011, the city had 4.5 million residents; the urban agglomeration, which comprises the city and its suburbs, was home to approximately 14.1 million, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in india. as of 2008, its gross domestic product (adjusted for purchasing power parity) was estimated to be us$104 billion, which would be third highest among indian cities, behind mumbai and delhi. as a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, kolkata confronts substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, and other logistic and socioeconomic problems.\u000ain the late 17th century, the three villages that predated kolkata were ruled by the nawab of bengal under mughal suzerainty. after the nawab granted the east india company a trading license in 1690, the area was developed by the company into an increasingly fortified mercantile base. nawab siraj ud-daulah retook kolkata in 1756 after the company started evading taxes and due to increasing militarisation of the fort. the east india company retook it in the following year and in 1793 assumed full sovereignty. under the company rule and later under the british raj, kolkata served as the capital of british-held territories in india until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in bengal, led to a shift of the capital to new delhi. the city was a centre of the indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. following indian independence in 1947, kolkata\u2014which was once the centre of modern indian education, science, culture, and politics\u2014witnessed several decades of economic stagnation.\u000aas a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century bengal renaissance and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in bengal and india, kolkata has established local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature that have gained wide audiences. many people from kolkata\u2014among them several nobel laureates\u2014have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. kolkata culture features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle intellectual exchanges (adda). west bengal's share of the bengali film industry is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the academy of fine arts, the victoria memorial, the asiatic society, the indian museum and the national library of india. among professional scientific institutions, kolkata hosts the agri horticultural society of india, the geological survey of india, the botanical survey of india, the calcutta mathematical society, the indian science congress association, the zoological survey of india, the institution of engineers, the anthropological survey of india and the indian public health association. though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, kolkata differs from other indian cities by giving importance to association football and other sports. all articles containing potentially dated statements articles containing bengali-language text articles containing potentially dated statements from 2001 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2003 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2004 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2006 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2008 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2009 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2011 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012 articles with dmoz links cs1 french-language sources (fr) cs1 maint: extra text cities and towns in west bengal coordinates on wikidata engvarb from may 2014 featured articles former capital cities in india former national capitals kolkata metropolitan cities in india populated places established in 1690 port cities in india settlement articles requiring maintenance use dmy dates from february 2015 wikipedia articles with bnf identifiers wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia articles with viaf identifiers wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages etymology history geography urban structure climate temperature rainfall environmental issues economy demographics government and public services civic administration utility services military and diplomatic establishments transport healthcare education culture media sports sister cities of kolkata see also references further reading external links

Vassembly language an assembly language (or assembler language) is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple architectures, but require interpreting or compiling.\u000aassembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler; the conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the code.\u000aassembly language uses a mnemonic to represent each low-level machine instruction or operation. typical operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction, and most assemblers can therefore take labels, symbols and expressions as operands to represent addresses and other constants, freeing the programmer from tedious manual calculations. macro assemblers include a macroinstruction facility so that (parameterized) assembly language text can be represented by a name, and that name can be used to insert the expanded text into other code. many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging.\u000asee the terminology section below for information regarding inconsistent use of the terms assembly and assembler. all articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases all articles with unsourced statements articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from november 2014 articles with unsourced statements from december 2014 articles with unsourced statements from february 2007 articles with unsourced statements from january 2009 articles with unsourced statements from march 2011 articles with unsourced statements from november 2011 assembly languages pages using web citations with no url programming language implementation wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers key conceptsedit assembleredit number of passesedit assembly languageedit language designedit basic elementsedit opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonicsedit data directivesedit assembly directivesedit macrosedit support for structured programmingedit use of assembly languageedit historical perspectiveedit current usageedit typical applicationsedit related terminologyedit list of assemblers for different computer architecturesedit further detailsedit example listing of assembly language source codeedit see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit

Vbihar bihar (/b\u0268\u02c8h\u0251r/; hindustani pronunciation: [b\u026a\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0r]) is a state in east india. it is the 13th largest state, with an area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi) and the 3rd largest by population; its population is the fastest-growing of any state. it is contiguous with uttar pradesh to its west, nepal to the north, the northern part of west bengal to the east, and with jharkhand to the south. the bihar plain is bifurcated by the river ganges which flows from west to east.\u000ain 2000, southern bihar was separated from bihar to form the new state of jharkhand. close to 85% of the population lives in villages. almost 58% of biharis are below the age of 25, which is the highest proportion of youngsters of the population of any state in india. hindi and urdu are the official languages of the state. other languages of the state are bhojpuri, maithili, magahi, bajjika, and angika, of which only maithili is recognized by the government of india.\u000abihar was a centre of power, learning and culture in ancient and classical india. from magadha arose india's first empire, the maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions, buddhism. magadha empires, notably under the maurya and gupta dynasties, unified large parts of south asia under a central rule.\u000asince the late 1970s, bihar has lagged behind other indian states in terms of its social and economic development. economists and social scientists claimed that this is a direct result of the policies of the central government, such as the freight equalization policy, its apathy towards bihar, lack of bihari sub-nationalism (resulting in no spokesperson for the state), and the permanent settlement of 1793 by the british east india company. the state government has however made significant strides in developing the state. the improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure, better health care facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a diminution in crime and corruption. 1912 establishments in india all wikipedia articles in need of updating all articles lacking reliable references all articles needing additional references all articles needing copy edit all articles needing style editing all articles with dead external links all articles with failed verification articles containing hindi-language text articles containing urdu-language text articles lacking reliable references from september 2015 articles needing additional references from july 2014 articles needing additional references from september 2015 articles with dmoz links articles with dead external links from april 2015 articles with dead external links from august 2015 articles with dead external links from february 2013 articles with dead external links from july 2010 articles with dead external links from october 2009 articles with failed verification from april 2015 bihar coordinates on wikidata hindustani-speaking countries and territories official website different in wikidata and wikipedia settlement articles requiring maintenance states and territories established in 1912 urdu-speaking countries and territories use british english from september 2013 use dmy dates from september 2013 wikipedia articles in need of updating from august 2015 wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 encyclopaedia britannica with wikisource reference wikipedia articles needing clarification from july 2014 wikipedia articles needing copy edit from september 2015 wikipedia articles needing rewrite from september 2015 wikipedia articles needing style editing from september 2015 wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia articles with viaf identifiers etymologyedit historyedit ancientedit medievaledit colonial eraedit geography and climateedit flora and faunaedit demographicsedit government and administrationedit politicsedit economyedit industryedit cultureedit language and literatureedit performing artsedit cinemaedit religionedit mediaedit transportationedit airwaysedit inland waterwaysedit tourismedit educationedit see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit

Viran iran (/a\u026a\u02c8ræn/ or /\u026a\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0n/; persian: \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u200e\u200e [\u0294i\u02d0\u02c8\u027e\u0251n]), historically known as persia (/\u02c8p\u025cr\u0292\u0259/ or /\u02c8p\u025cr\u0283\u0259/), officially the islamic republic of iran, is a country in western asia. it is bordered to the northwest by armenia, nagorno-karabakh republic and azerbaijan; with kazakhstan and russia across the caspian sea; to the northeast by turkmenistan; to the east by afghanistan and pakistan; to the south by the persian gulf and the gulf of oman; and to the west by turkey and iraq. comprising a land area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), it is the second-largest nation in the middle east and the 18th-largest in the world. with 78.4 million inhabitants, iran is the world's 17th most populous nation. it is the only country that has both a caspian sea and an indian ocean coastline. iran has long been of geostrategic importance because of its central location in eurasia and western asia, and its proximity to the strait of hormuz.\u000airan is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the proto-elamite and elamite kingdom in 3200\u20132800 bc. the iranian medes unified the area into the first of many empires in 625 bc, after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the region. iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the achaemenid empire founded by cyrus the great in 550 bc, which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient world, stretching from parts of the balkans (thrace-macedonia, bulgaria-paeonia) and eastern europe proper in the west, to the indus valley in the east, making it the largest empire the world had yet seen. the empire collapsed in 330 bc following the conquests of alexander the great. the parthian empire emerged from the ashes and was succeeded by the sassanid dynasty (neo-persian empire) in 224 ad, under which iran again became one of the leading powers in the world, along with the roman-byzantine empire, for a period of more than four centuries.\u000arashidun muslims invaded persia in 633 ad, and conquered it by 651 ad, largely replacing manichaeism and zoroastrianism. iran thereafter played a vital role in the subsequent islamic golden age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. the emergence in 1501 of the safavid dynasty, which promoted twelver shia islam as the official religion, marked one of the most important turning points in iranian and muslim history. starting in 1736 under nader shah, iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the sassanid empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire in the world. in the course of the 19th century, iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the caucasus region which made part of the concept of iran for three centuries, to neighboring imperial russia. the persian constitutional revolution of 1906 established the nation's first parliament, which operated within a constitutional monarchy. following a coup d'état instigated by the u.k. and the u.s. in 1953, iran gradually became very close allies with the united states and the rest of the west, remained secular, but grew increasingly autocratic. growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression culminated in the 1979 revolution, which led to the establishment of an islamic republic on 1 april 1979.\u000atehran is the capital and largest city, serving as the cultural, commercial, and industrial center of the nation. iran is a major regional and middle power, exerting considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy through its large reserves of fossil fuels, which include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves. it hosts asia's 4th-largest number of unesco world heritage sites.\u000airan is a founding member of the un, eco, nam, oic, and opec. its unique political system, based on the 1979 constitution, combines elements of a parliamentary democracy with a theocracy governed by the country's clergy, wherein the supreme leader wields significant influence. a multicultural nation comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups, most inhabitants are officially shia, iranian rial is the currency, and persian is the official language. 550s bc 6th-century bc establishments 6th-century bc establishments in asia all accuracy disputes all articles with dead

Vlac lac is the scarlet resinous secretion of a number of species of lac insects, of which the most commonly cultivated species is kerria lacca.\u000acultivation begins when a farmer gets a stick (broodlac) that contains eggs ready to hatch and ties it to the tree to be infested. thousands of lac insects colonize the branches of the host trees and secrete the resinous pigment. the coated branches of the host trees are cut and harvested as sticklac.\u000athe harvested sticklac is crushed and sieved to remove impurities. the sieved material is then repeatedly washed to remove insect parts and other soluble material. the resulting product is known as seedlac. the prefix seed refers to its pellet shape. seedlac which still contains 3-5% impurities is processed into shellac by heat treatment or solvent extraction.\u000athe leading producer of lac is jharkhand, followed by the chhattisgarh, west bengal, and maharashtra states of india. lac production is also found in bangladesh, myanmar, thailand, laos, vietnam, parts of china, and mexico. all articles with unsourced statements animal dyes articles with unsourced statements from october 2008 insect products resins scale insects etymology host trees harvesting uses production levels species see also references external links

Vmumbai mumbai (/m\u028am\u02c8ba\u026a/; also known as bombay, the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the indian state of maharashtra. it is the most populous city in india and the ninth most populous agglomeration in the world, with an estimated city population of 18.4 million. along with the neighbouring regions of the mumbai metropolitan region, it is one of the most populous urban regions in the world and the second most populous metropolitan area in india, with a population of 20.7 million as of 2011. mumbai lies on the west coast of india and has a deep natural harbour. in 2009, mumbai was named an alpha world city. it is also the wealthiest city in india, and has the highest gdp of any city in south, west, or central asia. mumbai has the highest number of billionaires and millionaires among all cities in india.\u000athe seven islands that came to constitute mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies. for centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the portuguese and subsequently to the british east india company when in 1661 king charles ii married the portuguese catherine of braganza, and as part of her dowry charles received the ports of tangier and seven islands of bombay. during the mid-18th century, bombay was reshaped by the hornby vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed bombay into a major seaport on the arabian sea. bombay in the 19th century was characterized by economic and educational development. during the early 20th century it became a strong base for the indian independence movement. upon india's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into bombay state. in 1960, following the samyukta maharashtra movement, a new state of maharashtra was created with bombay as the capital. the city was renamed mumbai in 1996.\u000amumbai is the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of india. it is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, generating 6.16% of india's gdp and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in india (mumbai port trust and jnpt), and 70% of capital transactions to india's economy. the city houses important financial institutions such as the reserve bank of india, the bombay stock exchange, the national stock exchange of india, the sebi and the corporate headquarters of numerous indian companies and multinational corporations. it is also home to some of india's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like barc, npcl, irel, tifr, aerb, aeci, and the department of atomic energy. the city also houses india's hindi (bollywood) and marathi film and television industry. mumbai's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living, attract migrants from all over india, making the city a melting pot of many communities and cultures. all articles with dead external links articles with dead external links from january 2015 articles with dead external links from march 2014 articles with dead external links from october 2013 cs1 italian-language sources (it) cs1 portuguese-language sources (pt) cs1 maint: unrecognized language cities and towns in mumbai city district coordinates on wikidata districts in india engvarb from february 2015 former portuguese colonies good articles metropolitan cities in india mumbai populated coastal places in india port cities and towns of the arabian sea port cities in india use dmy dates from august 2013 use dmy dates from june 2014 wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 encyclopaedia britannica with wikisource reference wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia articles with lccn identifiers wikipedia articles with viaf identifiers wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages etymologyedit historyedit early historyedit portuguese and british ruleedit independent indiaedit geographyedit climateedit economyedit civic administrationedit politicsedit transportedit public transportedit railedit busedit wateredit roadedit airedit seaedit utility servicesedit architectureedit demographicsedit ethnic groups and religionedit cultureedit mediaedit educationedit sportsedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit

Vunited states the united states of america (usa), commonly referred to as the united states (u.s.) or america, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions. the 48 contiguous states and washington, d.c., are in central north america between canada and mexico. the state of alaska is located in the northwestern part of north america and the state of hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-pacific. the territories are scattered about the pacific ocean and the caribbean sea. at 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. it is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. the geography and climate of the united states are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\u000apaleo-indians migrated from eurasia to what is now the u.s. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with european colonization beginning in the 16th century. the united states emerged from 13 british colonies located along the east coast. disputes between great britain and the colonies led to the american revolution. on july 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting great britain in the american revolutionary war, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the declaration of independence. the war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the united states by the kingdom of great britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a european colonial empire. the country's constitution was adopted on september 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. the first ten amendments, collectively named the bill of rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\u000adriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the united states embarked on a vigorous expansion across north america throughout the 19th century. this involved displacing american indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent. during the second half of the 19th century, the american civil war ended legal slavery in the country. by the end of that century, the united states extended into the pacific ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the industrial revolution, began to soar. the spanish\u2013american war and world war i confirmed the country's status as a global military power. the united states emerged from world war ii as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the united nations security council. the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 left the united states as the world's sole superpower.\u000athe united states is a developed country and has the world's largest economy by nominal and real gdp, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity. while the u.s. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. accounting for 34% of global military spending and 23% of world gdp, it is the world's foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations. 1776 establishments in the united states all wikipedia

Vmultiplication multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol "×", by a point "·" or by the absence of symbol) is one of the four elementary, mathematical operations of arithmetic; with the others being addition, subtraction and division.\u000athe multiplication of two whole numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, as the value of the other one:\u000a\u000afor example, 3 multiplied by 4 (often said as "3 times 4") can be calculated by adding 3 copies of 4 together:\u000a\u000ahere 3 and 4 are the "factors" and 12 is the "product".\u000aone of the main properties of multiplication is the commutative property, adding 3 copies of 4 gives the same result as adding 4 copies of 3:\u000a\u000athe multiplication of integers (including negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions) and real numbers is defined by a systematic generalization of this basic definition.\u000amultiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle (for whole numbers) or as finding the area of a rectangle whose sides have given lengths. the area of a rectangle does not depend on which side is measured first, which illustrates the commutative property.\u000athe inverse operation of the multiplication is the division. for example, since 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12, then 12 divided by 3 equals 4. multiplication by 3, followed by division by 3, yields the original number (since the division of a number other than 0 by itself equals 1).\u000amultiplication is also defined for other types of numbers, such as complex numbers, and more abstract constructs, like matrices. for these more abstract constructs, the order that the operands are multiplied sometimes does matter. a listing of the many different kinds of products that are used in mathematics is given in the product (mathematics) page. all articles needing additional references all articles with unsourced statements articles containing proofs articles needing additional references from april 2012 articles needing additional references from august 2011 articles with unsourced statements from august 2011 binary operations elementary arithmetic mathematical notation multiplication notation and terminology computation historical algorithms egyptians babylonians chinese modern method computer algorithms products of measurements products of sequences capital pi notation infinite products properties axioms multiplication with set theory multiplication in group theory multiplication of different kinds of numbers exponentiation see also notes references external links

abbr. bjp) is one of the two major parties in the indian political system, along with the indian national congress. as of 2014, it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies, and it is the world's largest party in terms of primary membership. the bjp is a right-wing party, with close ideological and organisational links to the hindu nationalist rashtriya swayamsevak sangh.\u000athe bjp's origins lie in the bharatiya jana sangh, formed in 1951 by syama prasad mookerjee. after the state of emergency in 1977, the jana sangh merged with several other parties to form the janata party; it defeated the incumbent congress party in the 1977 general election. after three years in power, the janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile jana sangh reconvening to form the bjp. although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength on the back of the ram janmabhoomi movement. following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the bjp became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.\u000aafter the 1998 general election, the bjp-led coalition known as the national democratic alliance (nda) formed a government under prime minister atal bihari vajpayee for a year. following fresh elections, the nda government, again headed by vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-congress government to do so. in the 2004 general election, the nda suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the bjp was the principal opposition party. long time gujarat chief minister narendra modi led it to a landslide victory in the 2014 general election. since that election, modi leads the nda government as prime minister and as of march 2015, the alliance governs 13 states.\u000athe official ideology of the bjp is "integral humanism", first formulated by deendayal upadhyaya in 1965. the party expresses a commitment to hindutva, and its policy has historically reflected hindu nationalist positions. the bjp advocates social conservatism and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. its key issues have included the abrogation of the special status to jammu and kashmir, the building of a ram temple in ayodhya and the implementation of a uniform civil code. however, the 1998\u20132004 nda government did not pursue any of these controversial issues. it instead focused on a largely neoliberal economic policy prioritizing globalisation and economic growth over social welfare. 1980 establishments in india all articles containing potentially dated statements articles containing potentially dated statements from 2014 articles containing potentially dated statements from april 2015 articles containing potentially dated statements from march 2015 bharatiya janata party conservative parties in india engvarb from january 2015 good articles hindutva indian hindu political parties nationalist parties political parties established in 1980 right-wing parties use british english from august 2013 use dmy dates from june 2014 wikipedia pending changes protected pages (level 1) wikipedia protected pages without expiry historyedit formation and early daysedit babri masjid demolition and the hindutva movementedit 2002 gujarat violenceedit general election defeatsedit general election resultsedit ideology and political positionsedit social policies and hindutvaedit economic policiesedit defence and terrorismedit foreign policyedit organisation and structureedit presence in various statesedit list of current nda chief ministersedit see alsoedit notes and referencesedit referencesedit sourcesedit further readingedit external linksedit bharatiya janata party\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 president amit shah parliamentary chairperson narendra modi lok sabha leader narendra modi(prime minister) rajya sabha leader arun jaitley founded 6 april 1980 (35 years ago) (1980-04-06) preceded by bharatiya jana sanghjanata party headquarters 11 ashoka road,new delhi 110001 newspaper kamal sandesh youth wing bharatiya janata yuva morcha women's wing bjp mahila morcha peasant's wing bjp kisan morcha membership 110 million (july 2015)[1] ideology conservatismsocial conservatismgandhian socialism[2]integral humanismhindu nationalismhindutva political position right-wing[2][3][4] international affiliation none colours saffron eci status national party[5] alliance national democratic alliance (nda) seats in lok sabha 280 / 545[6](currently 542 members + 1 speaker) seats in rajya sabha 48 / 245[7](currently 244 members) seats in vidhan sabha 1,030 / 4,120 seats in vidhan parishad 72 / 454 election symbol website www.bjp.org politics of indiapolitical partieselections

metropolitan france alone is 64.3 million. it is a unitary semi-presidential republic. the capital of france is paris, the country's largest city with population of 6,7 million inhabitants within the city limits [9] as of 1 january 2016 and an urban population of 10,858,000 the third-largest in europe and largest in the european union, the main cultural and commercial center. the constitution of france establishes the state as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people.\u000aduring the iron age, what is now metropolitan france was inhabited by the gauls, a celtic people. the gauls were conquered by the roman empire in 51 bc, which held gaul until 486. the gallo-romans faced raids and migration from the germanic franks, who dominated the region for hundreds of years, eventually creating the medieval kingdom of france. france has been a major power in europe since the late middle ages, with its victory in the hundred years' war (1337 to 1453) strengthening french state-building and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy. during the renaissance, france experienced a vast cultural development and established the first steps of a worldwide colonial empire. the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between catholics and protestants (huguenots).\u000alouis xiv made france the dominant cultural, political and military power in europe, but in the late 18th century, the monarchy was overthrown in the french revolution. one legacy of the revolution was the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. france was governed as one of history's earliest republics until the empire was declared by napoleon, who dominated european affairs and had a long-lasting impact on western culture. following his defeat at the end of the napoleonic wars, france endured a tumultuous succession of governments: an absolute monarchy was restored, replaced in 1830 by a constitutional monarchy, then briefly by a second republic, and then by a second empire, until a more lasting french third republic was established in 1870.\u000afrance's colonial empire reached the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. in world war i, france was one of the main winners as part of the triple entente powers fighting against the central powers. france was also one of the allied powers in world war ii, but it was occupied by the axis powers in 1940. following liberation in 1944, a fourth republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the algerian war. the fifth republic, led by charles de gaulle, came into being in 1958 and continues to operate today. in the era of decolonization, most of the french colonial empire became independent after the second world war.\u000athroughout its long history, france has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. it hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural unesco world heritage sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually\u2014the most of any country in the world. france remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in europe and around the world. it is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal gdp and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity. in terms of total wealth, france is the wealthiest nation in europe and fourth in the world. it also possesses the world's second-largest exclusive economic zone (eez), covering 11,035,000 square kilometres (4,261,000 sq mi).\u000afrench citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. france is a founding member of the united nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the un security council. it is a member of numerous international institutions, including the group of 7, north atlantic treaty organization (nato), organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), the world trade organization (wto), and la francophonie. france is a

Vmother's boy mother's boy, also mummy's boy or mama's boy, is a term for a man who is excessively attached to his mother at an age when men are expected to be independent (e.g. live on their own, be economically independent, married to a woman or about to be married). anecdotally, this age of independence varies throughout each strata of every human society in the world, sometimes greatly. a mother's boy may be effete or effeminate, or might be perceived as being macho, or might have a personality disorder, such as avoidant personality disorder, or might be schizophrenic, so that the mother acts as a caretaker. in any case, a mother's boy cannot maintain a healthy partnership with a woman (martyn carruthers, 1998).\u000ain classical freudian psychoanalytic theory, the term oedipus complex denotes a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. sigmund freud believed that a child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the oedipus complex. if this identification fails, the boy remains a lifelong mama's boy.\u000abeing mother-bonded is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness, and has a social stigma attached to it in many places, although in other places it may be more acceptable or perceived as normal. a mother-bonded man is seen to give control of his own life to his mother. all stub articles pejorative terms for people psychology stubs stock characters terms for males see alsoedit referencesedit

Velection an election is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. this process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.\u000athe universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient athens, where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.\u000aelectoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).\u000ato elect means "to choose or make a decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the united states. all articles needing additional references articles needing additional references from december 2013 commons category with local link same as on wikidata decision theory elections use dmy dates from july 2012 wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers historyedit characteristicsedit suffrageedit nominationedit electoral systemsedit schedulingedit election campaignsedit difficulties with electionsedit see alsoedit referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit

Vhumour humour, or humor\u2014see spelling differences\u2014is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. the term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (latin: humor, "body fluid"), controlled human health and emotion.\u000apeople of all ages and cultures respond to humour. most people are able to experience humour\u2014be amused, smile or laugh at something funny\u2014and thus are considered to have a sense of humour. the hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour induced by humour to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context. for example, young children may favour slapstick such as punch and judy puppet shows or cartoons such as tom and jerry, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. by contrast, sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to the mature audience. all articles with unsourced statements articles with dmoz links articles with unsourced statements from march 2012 cs1 errors: dates commons category with local link different than on wikidata defence mechanisms genres humour use british english from november 2010 wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia move-protected pages wikipedia pending changes protected pages (level 1) wikipedia protected pages without expiry theoriesedit viewsedit humour in the workplaceedit sociological factorsedit ancient greeceedit indiaedit in arabic cultureedit caribbeanedit chinaedit social transformation model of humouredit physical attractivenessedit physiological effects of humouredit formulaedit root componentsedit methodsedit exaggerationedit cultureedit see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit

Vunited states the united states of america (usa), commonly referred to as the united states (u.s.) or america, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions. the 48 contiguous states and washington, d.c., are in central north america between canada and mexico. the state of alaska is located in the northwestern part of north america and the state of hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-pacific. the territories are scattered about the pacific ocean and the caribbean sea. at 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. it is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. the geography and climate of the united states are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\u000apaleo-indians migrated from eurasia to what is now the u.s. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with european colonization beginning in the 16th century. the united states emerged from 13 british colonies located along the east coast. disputes between great britain and the colonies led to the american revolution. on july 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting great britain in the american revolutionary war, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the declaration of independence. the war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the united states by the kingdom of great britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a european colonial empire. the country's constitution was adopted on september 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. the first ten amendments, collectively named the bill of rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\u000adriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the united states embarked on a vigorous expansion across north america throughout the 19th century. this involved displacing american indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent. during the second half of the 19th century, the american civil war ended legal slavery in the country. by the end of that century, the united states extended into the pacific ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the industrial revolution, began to soar. the spanish\u2013american war and world war i confirmed the country's status as a global military power. the united states emerged from world war ii as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the united nations security council. the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 left the united states as the world's sole superpower.\u000athe united states is a developed country and has the world's largest economy by nominal and real gdp, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity. while the u.s. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. accounting for 34% of global military spending and 23% of world gdp, it is the world's foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations. 1776 establishments in the united states all wikipedia

Vkolkata kolkata /ko\u028al\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0t\u0251\u02d0/, formerly calcutta /kæl\u02c8k\u028ct\u0259/, is the capital of the indian state of west bengal. located on the east bank of the hooghly river, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of east india, while the port of kolkata is india's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port. as of 2011, the city had 4.5 million residents; the urban agglomeration, which comprises the city and its suburbs, was home to approximately 14.1 million, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in india. as of 2008, its gross domestic product (adjusted for purchasing power parity) was estimated to be us$104 billion, which would be third highest among indian cities, behind mumbai and delhi. as a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, kolkata confronts substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, and other logistic and socioeconomic problems.\u000ain the late 17th century, the three villages that predated kolkata were ruled by the nawab of bengal under mughal suzerainty. after the nawab granted the east india company a trading license in 1690, the area was developed by the company into an increasingly fortified mercantile base. nawab siraj ud-daulah retook kolkata in 1756 after the company started evading taxes and due to increasing militarisation of the fort. the east india company retook it in the following year and in 1793 assumed full sovereignty. under the company rule and later under the british raj, kolkata served as the capital of british-held territories in india until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in bengal, led to a shift of the capital to new delhi. the city was a centre of the indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. following indian independence in 1947, kolkata\u2014which was once the centre of modern indian education, science, culture, and politics\u2014witnessed several decades of economic stagnation.\u000aas a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century bengal renaissance and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in bengal and india, kolkata has established local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature that have gained wide audiences. many people from kolkata\u2014among them several nobel laureates\u2014have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. kolkata culture features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle intellectual exchanges (adda). west bengal's share of the bengali film industry is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the academy of fine arts, the victoria memorial, the asiatic society, the indian museum and the national library of india. among professional scientific institutions, kolkata hosts the agri horticultural society of india, the geological survey of india, the botanical survey of india, the calcutta mathematical society, the indian science congress association, the zoological survey of india, the institution of engineers, the anthropological survey of india and the indian public health association. though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, kolkata differs from other indian cities by giving importance to association football and other sports. all articles containing potentially dated statements articles containing bengali-language text articles containing potentially dated statements from 2001 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2003 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2004 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2005 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2006 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2008 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2009 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2011 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012 articles with dmoz links cs1 french-language sources (fr) cs1 maint: extra text cities and towns in west bengal coordinates on wikidata engvarb from may 2014 featured articles former capital cities in india former national capitals kolkata metropolitan cities in india populated places established in 1690 port cities in india settlement articles requiring maintenance use dmy dates from february 2015 wikipedia articles with bnf identifiers wikipedia articles with gnd identifiers wikipedia articles with viaf identifiers wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages etymology history geography urban structure climate temperature rainfall environmental issues economy demographics government and public services civic administration utility services military and diplomatic establishments transport healthcare education culture media sports sister cities of kolkata see also references further reading external links

wildlife.\u000apaleo-indians migrated from eurasia to what is now the u.s. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with european colonization beginning in the 16th century. the united states emerged from 13 british colonies located along the east coast. disputes between great britain and the colonies led to the american revolution. on july 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting great britain in the american revolutionary war, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the declaration of independence. the war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the united states by the kingdom of great britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a european colonial empire. the country's constitution was adopted on september 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. the first ten amendments, collectively named the bill of rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\u000adriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the united states embarked on a vigorous expansion across north america throughout the 19th century. this involved displacing american indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent. during the second half of the 19th century, the american civil war ended legal slavery in the country. by the end of that century, the united states extended into the pacific ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the industrial revolution, began to soar. the spanish\u2013american war and world war i confirmed the country's status as a global military power. the united states emerged from world war ii as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the united nations security council. the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 left the united states as the world's sole superpower.\u000athe united states is a developed country and has the world's largest economy by nominal and real gdp, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity. while the u.s. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. accounting for 34% of global military spending and 23% of world gdp, it is the world's foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations. 1776 establishments in the united states all wikipedia

Vwi-fi wi-fi (or wifi) is a local area wireless computer networking technology that allows electronic devices to network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) uhf and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) shf ism radio bands.\u000athe wi-fi alliance defines wi-fi as any "wireless local area network" (wlan) product based on the institute of electrical and electronics engineers' (ieee) 802.11 standards. however, the term "wi-fi" is used in general english as a synonym for "wlan" since most modern wlans are based on these standards. "wi-fi" is a trademark of the wi-fi alliance. the "wi-fi certified" trademark can only be used by wi-fi products that successfully complete wi-fi alliance interoperability certification testing.\u000amany devices can use wi-fi, e.g. personal computers, video-game consoles, smartphones, digital cameras, tablet computers and digital audio players. these can connect to a network resource such as the internet via a wireless network access point. such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors. hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.\u000a\u000awi-fi can be less secure than wired connections, such as ethernet, precisely because an intruder does not need a physical connection. web pages that use tls are secure, but unencrypted internet access can easily be detected by intruders. because of this, wi-fi has adopted various encryption technologies. the early encryption wep proved easy to break. higher quality protocols (wpa, wpa2) were added later. an optional feature added in 2007, called wi-fi protected setup (wps), had a serious flaw that allowed an attacker to recover the router's password. the wi-fi alliance has since updated its test plan and certification program to ensure all newly certified devices resist attacks. 1999 introductions all articles containing potentially dated statements all articles with unsourced statements articles containing potentially dated statements from 2007 articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010 articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from march 2010 articles with unsourced statements from april 2013 articles with unsourced statements from april 2015 articles with unsourced statements from march 2010 articles with unsourced statements from september 2011 articles with unsourced statements from september 2012 commons category with page title same as on wikidata ieee 802.11 networking standards pages using citations with format and no url wi-fi wireless networking historyedit usesedit internet accessedit interferenceedit throughputedit hardwareedit standard devicesedit embedded systemsedit rangeedit multiple access pointsedit network securityedit data security risksedit securing methodsedit piggybackingedit safetyedit see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit

Vtime time is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions.\u000atime has long been a major subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars. nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems. some simple definitions of time include "time is what clocks measure", which is a problematically vague and self-referential definition that utilizes the device used to measure the subject as the definition of the subject, and "time is what keeps everything from happening at once", which is without substantive meaning in the absence of the definition of simultaneity in the context of the limitations of human sensation, observation of events, and the perception of such events.\u000atwo contrasting viewpoints on time divide many prominent philosophers. one view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe\u2014a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. sir isaac newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as newtonian time. the opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of "container" that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events. this second view, in the tradition of gottfried leibniz and immanuel kant, holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled.\u000atime is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the international system of units and international system of quantities. time is used to define other quantities\u2014such as velocity\u2014so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. an operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. the operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural philosophy.\u000afurthermore, it may be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether or not time itself is "felt", as a sensation, or is a judgment, is a matter of debate.\u000atemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("time is money") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans. all articles containing potentially dated statements all articles with unsourced statements articles containing potentially
